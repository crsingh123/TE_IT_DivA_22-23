## Description
Introduction to Crops Guru, a Crop Recommendation System as Farmers often face
challenges in identifying the optimal crop to grow on their farmland, The availability of
various crops, soil quality, weather conditions, and market demand creates confusion and can
result in low yield and financial loss for farmers.

So the solution we proposed is The Crops Guru is a web-based application that recommends
the best crop for farmers based on their farmland's characteristics, historical weather patterns,
and market demand. The system analyzes soil quality and provides suitable fertilization
recommendations. Crops Guru uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical
weather data and predict weather patterns to recommend the best time for planting. The
system also provides real-time market demand data for crops to help farmers make informed
decisions regarding the sale of their crops. Overall, Crops Guru aims to provide a
comprehensive crop recommendation system that integrates soil, weather, and market
demand data to help farmers optimize their crop yield and profitability.
