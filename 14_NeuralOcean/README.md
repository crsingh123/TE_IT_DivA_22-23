Garbage detection in the ocean using machine learning involves using computer algorithms to analyze data from various sources, such as satellite imagery and ocean sensors, to identify and locate marine debris. The ML models are trained on labeled data to recognize patterns and features of different types of debris and distinguish them from natural features. The use of ML for garbage detection in the ocean can aid in the development of effective strategies for removing and preventing marine debris, which can have harmful impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Some challenges in this area include dealing with the large amounts of data, addressing data quality issues, and developing models that can accurately detect small and fragmented pieces of debris.
